How it Works-Power Apps?
Users log in with their Organization Account, which must be pre-set on their device. At the beginning user have to select Stage Where he/she is checking. When checking a vehicle, users must scan the VIN, battery number, and enter the battery voltage and current (if readings are available). For checks conducted in the VQA (before fitment), users need to scan the battery number and enter the voltage reading. Currently, batteries are checked on a sample basis in the VQA; however, we recommend conducting 100% battery checks at this stage. Data is automatically sent to the Cloud Database (SharePoint), where it is analyzed and linked to the RIYA System at intervals of every 10 minutes.
